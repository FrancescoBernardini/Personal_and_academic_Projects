This folder contains the homotopy candidates generated by the procedure described 
in [] for the constrained 2D network problem with 5 terminals and 4 obstacles. 
The 5 free trees generate a total of 35 homotopy candidates (3+12+8+8+4) and this set 
contains the optimal one. This spares approximately 95% of the computation, providing only 
homotopy candidates that are affine to the obstacle distribution.
