**#1 - AFMotor class update**
The folder AFMotor_Mod contains the modifications I did to the AFMotor class in order to associate to it some 
parameters of the motor, that is handy to have associated to the class instance itself, such as:
1) the Arduino pin the motor is attached to
2) The current voltage read by the Arduino pin
3) The treshold that the user wants to set for the movement of a given motor, and that can be different for each motor.
